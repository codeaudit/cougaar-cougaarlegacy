<B><U><FONT SIZE=4><P>Abstract</P>
</B></U></FONT><P>The Sam toolset has been developed to assist Cougaar users in creating, visualizing, maintaining, and assessing the correctness of Cougaar societies. Sam displays both the explicit structure of societies and the implicit structure formed from producer/consumer relationships between plugins and clusters. Using the publish and subscribe contracts, Sam calculates the producer/consumer dependency graph and shows these publish/subscribe dependencies as directed links. This makes many simple configuration errors obvious and speeds understanding of plugin coupling.</P>
<P>Using the dependency graph, Sam is also able to analyze the society and report cases where there is no publication matching a subscription, more than one subscription matching a publication, or no subscription matching a publication. These simple checks catch many of errors caused by missing or mutually exclusive plugins being instantiated in a cluster.</P>
<P>Sam is able to go a step further and also help with building the configurations. A <I>suggest</I> capability allows the user to ask for suggested sets of plugins to fill gaps in a configuration. Sam examines the available plugins and suggests which set of plugins would match the dangling publications and subscriptions in the cluster. Expanding the accuracy and utility of this design assistance is the focus of the current Sam effort and we expect to include extended capabilities in version 3.0 of the toolset.</P>

</U><P>1.<U>Introduction to the Sam’s User Interface</P>
</U><I><P>Sam</B></I> provides a single view for basic functions, configuration management</P>
<P>The <I>User Interface</I> consists of a window that contains several panes and panels for performing these functions. </P>
<P>The <I>User Interface</I> contains the following elements:</P>

<UL>
<I><U><LI>Main Menu Bar</I></U>: This provides access to many menus, such as File, Edit, View and Help.&#9; </LI>
<I><U><LI>Main Tool Bar</I></U>: Composed of buttons, which provide shortcuts to the commands. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Project Pane</I></U>: Displays the contents of the Society that is currently selected. The Society tree can be used to step into and step out of the society. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Editor Pane</I></U>: Contains another tool bar that gives the options to edit, save, print or clear the displayed contracts. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Main Panel</I></U>: This is where the opened societies can be viewed. Each opened society has a tab at the top that displays the name of the society. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Error Pane</I></U>: It displays the different problems that are associated with the opened societies. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Status Bar</I></U>: This is updated every time some process is performed on the society.</LI></UL>

</I><LI>Main Menu Bar</U>:</LI></OL>


<UL>
<I><U><LI>File Menu</I></U>: The File menu helps the user load a particular society both from the". xml" file and the ". ini" files. The Load Society option opens an open dialog box from which the user can choose a particular society that is to be loaded from the xml file. The save society option on the other hand opens a save dialog box using which the society can be saved with as particular xml file and the contracts for that particular society can be saved as the "contracts.xml" file. The "Import from ini" and the "Export to ini" options load a society from the ini files and save a society to the ini files. The print menu helps in printing the graphical representation of the society either as a canvas printout or as a screen snapshot as the requirement may be. The file menu also gives the option of closing one or all the societies at the same time. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Edit Menu</I></U>: The Edit menu helps in the editing of the graphical representation of the society. It can be used to view the system properties, insert plugins, clusters, communities and contracts as per requirement. The edit menu also aids in cut, copy and pasting of the components. It also aids in the retaining of the particular solution of user’s interest. </LI>
<I><U><LI>View Menu</I></U>: The view menu helps in the viewing of the lay out that displays the present graphical representation. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Help Menu</I></U>: Loads the Java Documentation files and user manuals for the application. </LI></UL>
<DIR>

<P>1.2 <U>Main Tool Bar</U>: The main tool bar is composed of the following buttons.</P></DIR>


<UL>
<I><U><LI>Open Button</I></U>: Performs the same function as the "Import from the ini" command of the file menu of the main menu bar. It opens a dialog box from which the society that needs to be loaded can be selected. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Save Button</I></U>: Performs the same function as the save society command of the file menu of the main menu bar. It opens a dialog box through which the society can be saved with a particular name. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Print Button</I></U>: This also aids in printing, but does not give the user an option of a canvas printout or a screen snap shot. It only prints in the canvas printout mode. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Back and Forward Buttons</I></U>: Once the society is loaded the three buttons, which are on the main tool bar can be accessed. These three buttons are grouped into one unit because of their functionality. Once the user has stepped into the society, the previous pages where the user had been can be accessed until there is no back or a forward page to go to. The main aspect of these buttons is their ability to be associated with only a single tab or rather to a single society. Though the users can move between the tabs, the ability to go back and forward is associated only with a single society or rather a single tab. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Parent Button</I></U>: This lets the user to access the parent component of the displayed components. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Analyze Button</I></U>: This will let the user analyze if there are any kinds of problems associated with the society. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Suggest Button</I></U>: This suggests the different kinds of solutions that are appropriate if there are any problems found in the society. The solutions are displayed in the form new tabbed panes in the main panel with there own associated tabs, which bear their names. The required solution can be retained by clicking on the retain command in the edit menu of the main menu. </LI>
<I><U><LI>Help Button</I></U>: Loads the Java Documentation files for the application. It also displays the version details for the application.</LI></UL>

<P>Once the Application is up and running, the Sam user interface can be used to load a society from the xml files. Once the "load society" command is clicked a file open dialog box pops up providing the user to choose from the list of the xml file. Once the choice is made the Main Panel will show the graphical representation of the society, for the xml that has been selected. From here the user can step into or out of the society. Stepping into the society at this point will display the graphical representation of the clusters and the communities that are available with in that society.&nbsp;</P>
