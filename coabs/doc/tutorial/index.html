<h1 align="center">ALP/Cougaar Liaison Capability Tutorial</h1>
<hr color="#800080">
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">If you have read through the <a href="../javadoc/index.html"> overview
  Javadoc</a>, reviewed the <a href="../javadoc/com/prc/alp/liaison/doc-files/ALP%20External%20Agent%20Liaison%201200.html">
  presentation slides</a> for the liaison capability, and browsed through some of
  the package and class Javadocs, you are ready to explore the mechanics of
  actually implementing useful liaisons between your ALP/Cougaar society and
  some external agents. This short tutorial is designed to lead you through the
  fundamental steps with example code illustrating the key concepts, and with
  additional discussion that explores alternatives and ramifications.</p>
  <p align="left"><i>Note</i>: the tutorial assumes that the liaison capability
  has already been properly <a href="../install/index.html"> installed and
  configured</a>. Although it is not
  dependent upon the <a href="../demo/liaison_demo.html"> weather demonstration</a> (including the
  Litton TASC AEF society and
  RETSINA InfoAgents), the liaison capability does require Jini and
  JavaSpaces services in order to function properly.&nbsp; These constraints
  are discussed in the section on liaison operation.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><a href="plugins.html">Liaison PlugIns</a></b>  shows how
  to begin by providing an environment in which ALP/Cougaar PlugIns can identify
  themselves and perform interactions with external agents.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><a href="deputies.html">Liaison Deputies</a></b> describes how to
  initialize communications with external agent societies</p>
  <p align="left"><b><a href="basic.html">Basic Interactors</a></b> shows how to construct the core
  components required to implement specialized interactions between an
  ALP/Cougaar agent and some external agent.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><a href="interactions.html">Interactions</a></b> explores the concept of liaison
  interactions and the state-driven engine that drives all liaison activity.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><a href="multithread.html">Multithread Interactors</a></b> explores the problem of
  building interactors that must be manipulated by multiple threads.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><a href="timeouts.html">Timeouts</a></b> shows how to set timeout limits at different
  levels within an interaction and how to deal with them when they occur.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><a href="administration.html">Liaison Administration</a></b> discusses the experimental
  JavaSpace-based facility for controlling liaison permissions and how to use or
  bypass it.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><a href="factories.html">Interaction Factories</a></b> describes how to deal with
  interactions that are initiated by external agents, and how to enable deputies
  to instantiate these interaction when needed without requiring repeated
  intervention by a PlugIn.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><a href="operation.html">Liaison Operation</a></b> covers the mechanics of getting
  liaisons running, including the Jini and JavaSpace services upon which they
  (currently) depend.</p>
