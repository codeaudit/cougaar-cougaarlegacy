<h2 align="left"><b>Multithread Interactors</b></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our example <code>TrafficMonitorInitiator</code> is trying
to get sensor information from some remote agent(s).&nbsp; An <code>Interactor</code>
may receive information two ways from an external CoABS agent:&nbsp; it may
invoke an accessible RMI method of the external agent (i.e., as returned by a <code>CoABSLookupInteractor</code>)
that returns some useful value, or it may rely on the external agent to send a
message in a mutually understood language that contains the desired
information.&nbsp; In the first case, the <code>Interactor</code> will wait
(probably in its <code>send</code> action method) until the RMI method
completes; in fact, the code for the <code>CoABSLookupInteractor</code> contains
an example of this strategy.&nbsp; In the second case, the <code>CoABSLiaisonDeputy</code>
provides an RMI proxy to accept incoming messages for all interactions using
that deputy, but it then needs to correctly associate each received message with
the appropriate <code>Interaction</code> instance and make the message available
within the scope of the correct interaction thread.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let's assume that the liaison between our <code>
TrafficMonitorInitiator</code> and an external agent will use this second method, so
the external agent will be sending back messages that will be accepted by the <code>CoABSLiaisonDeputy</code>.&nbsp; We need
to establish some way to ensure that the <code>CoABSLiaisonDeputy</code> will be
able to place these messages in a context accessible to the <code>TrafficMonitorInitiator</code>
when it is ready to use these messages (probably in its <code>receive</code>
action method).&nbsp; The appropriate way to arrange this is to make use of the
more capable <code>MultithreadInteractor</code> interface, which adds a single
method to the existing <code>Interactor</code> interface:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>public interface MultithreadInteractor
  extends Interactor {
  
  public boolean handle (Object obj, Object context, Interaction iaction);
  
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <code>handle</code> method combines two
functions.&nbsp; First, it allows some thread other than the interaction thread
to pass an arbitrary object (the first argument) and an arbitrary context for
interpreting or using that object (the second argument) into a <code>MultithreadInteractor</code>,
while that <code>MultithreadInteractor</code> is actively being used by an
interaction thread.&nbsp; Second, the <code>handle</code> method returns a
boolean value which allows the <code>MultithreadInteractor</code> to inform the
caller whether the supplied object was successfully used (handled).&nbsp; A
handle method should never called within an interaction thread, while other <code>Interactor</code>
action methods (e.g., <code>send</code>, <code>normalEnd</code>, etc.) should
never be called <i>outside </i>of an interaction thread.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><code>handle</code> methods are used by the <code>CoABSLiaisonDeputy</code>,
which maintains a list of active interactions.&nbsp; Each time the deputy
receives a new message from an external agent, it passes the message as the
first argument to the <code>handle</code> method of each <code>MultithreadInteractor</code>
associated with an active <code>Interaction</code>.&nbsp; (Since a given <code>Interactor</code>
[not just a <code>MultithreadInteractor</code>] could be shared by multiple
interaction threads, all of its methods are passed an <code>Interaction</code>
instance in some argument so that they can determine which active <code>Interaction</code>
serves as their current context.&nbsp; The methods of such a
&quot;shareable&quot; <code>Interactor</code> should probably be synchronized to
prevent race conditions.)&nbsp; If a handle method does not recognize the
message as belonging to its current <code>Interactor</code>/<code>Interaction</code>
combination, then it should ignore the message and return <code>false</code>;
otherwise, it should do whatever is required to process the message quickly
(e.g., save its contents somewhere) and return <code>true</code>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once a message has been successfully &quot;handled&quot; by
some <code>MultithreadInteractor</code>, the <code>CoABSLiaisonDeputy</code>
assumes that the message has been (or will eventually be) correctly used in the
appropriate interaction thread, and the deputy stops testing further active
interactions with that message.&nbsp; If <i>no </i><code>handle</code> method
associated with an active <code>Interaction</code> accepts the message, the
deputy assumes that the received message represents an attempt to initiate a new
interaction by an external agent, and follows procedures we will describe later.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For now, we can simply elaborate our <code>TrafficMonitorInitiator</code>&nbsp;
more to give it the necessary capabilities.&nbsp; At the same time, we will
expose more functions of the deputy.&nbsp; These new functions depend heavily on
an important feature of <code>Interaction</code> instances: each is tagged with
a unique ID string (accessible through the <code>Interaction.getID</code>
method).&nbsp; The new code is colored in <font color="#FF0000">red</font>:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We've made some significant changes.&nbsp; To make them easier to grasp,
we'll consider the methods in the order in which they would normally be invoked
(except for <code>nextAction</code>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The constructor (invoked by the PlugIn) is passed references to a <code>CoABSLiaisonDeputy</code>
    and an <code>AgentRep</code> for the external agent (see CoABS documentation
    for more information on this class), and it saves them for later use.</li>
  <li>The <code>begin</code> method (invoked by the interaction thread) takes its
    initialization state object and saves it for later use.&nbsp; Remember that
    this is the third argument passed to the <code>Interaction</code>
    constructor, and is passed on to our <code>begin</code> method once the <code>Interaction</code>'s
    <code>start</code> method is called.</li>
  <li>The <code>send</code> method (invoked by the interaction thread) creates a
    message that it transmits to the external agent by invoking its <code>addMessage</code>
    method (see CoABS documentation for more information on this method).&nbsp; <code>send</code>
    then has the deputy save a reference to this <code>Interaction</code> to
    allow it to be matched against future incoming messages.</li>
  <li>The <code>handle</code> method (invoked by the deputy) is asked to process
    an incoming CoABS message.&nbsp; Assuming that originating agent matches the
    external agent we expect, and that some part of the incoming message can be
    extracted and matched against the interaction reference saved by the <code>send</code>
    method, <code>handle</code> has the deputy save the actual reply text.&nbsp;
    The reply is saved with a key that matches the original interaction ID.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, the <code>receive</code> method (invoked by the interaction
    thread) has been periodically polling the deputy to see if a reply
    associated with the current <code>Interaction</code> has yet been
    received.&nbsp; (In the next section we'll examine why it invokes the <code>Interaction.sleep</code>
    method instead of the more conventional <code>Thread.sleep</code>
    method.)&nbsp; Once this happens (i.e., after the <code>handle</code> method
    runs successfully), <code>receive</code> extracts some reply object from the
    reply text and asks the deputy to save it.</li>
  <li>The <code>normalEnd</code> method (invoked by the interaction thread)
    retrieves the last (and only) reply object associated with this <code>Interaction</code>
    and returns it.&nbsp; If the PlugIn that started this <code>Interaction</code>
    waited for it to complete, then the reply object will be returned as the
    value of the <code>Interaction</code>'s <code>start</code> method.&nbsp;
    Otherwise, the PlugIn can check in the future to see if the <code>Interaction</code>
    has completed (by calling <code>Interaction.isDone</code>) and then retrieve
    the final result at that time (by calling <code>LiaisonDeputy.finishInteraction</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, our <code>TrafficMonitorInitiator</code> and PlugIn are going to
be in trouble if the external agent crashes or a reply message gets lost; the <code>receive</code>
method may end up waiting forever for a reply that will never appear.&nbsp; The
next section looks into this problem further.</p>
