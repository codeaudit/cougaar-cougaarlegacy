<h1 align="left">ALP External Agent Liaison Capability Release Notes</h1>
<h2 align="left">Latest Release Version: 1.0</h2>
<h2 align="left">Latest Release Date: 11/27/00</h2>
<h3 align="left">Summary</h3>
<p align="left">This is the first official release of the ALP external agent
liaison capability.&nbsp; It includes a demonstration of interoperability
between an ALP society, the CoABS Grid, and a RETSINA-based information agent
that supplies weather forecasts.</p>
<h3 align="left">Changes from prior release (version 0.9)</h3>
<h4 align="left">New capabilities and improvements</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The ALP weather forecasting task was split into a weather
    requirement task (one per affected prepare-for-transport task) and a
    get-forecast task.&nbsp; Get-forecast tasks are now multi-parent tasks that
    are a composition of multiple weather requirement tasks representing the
    same location and date.&nbsp; The WeatherLiaisonPlugIn now updates
    get-forecast results from forecast data acquired via the Grid, and the
    weather trigger updates the itinerary of the affected prepare-for-transport
    tasks when the results flow back through the task compositions.&nbsp; The
    weather trigger also saves the original itineraries for later display and
    comparison.&nbsp; Defunct weather requirements (for past-current dates or
    for unknown locations) are correctly purged from the plan.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">A new PSP exists (liaison/demo/WEATHER_IMPACT.PSP) that
    displays the results of weather forecast requests and their impact on
    prepare-for-transport tasks.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">A software brake that regulated the speed of spawning new
    queries to the RETSINA information agent has been removed.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Portions of the Liaison Administration Tool GUI were
    implemented with multiple threads to improve apparent response times.</li>
</ul>
<h4 align="left">Bug fixes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Corrected a race condition which caused the Liaison
    Administration Tool GUI to fail to update liaison status properly under
    certain circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<h4 align="left">Installation information</h4>
<p align="left">See <a href="install/index.html">the installation instructions.</a></p>
